Send2Trash Ports is a collection (currently only Unix/Mono .NET with no specific plans any others, just leaving it open for expansion) of libraries that allow files and directories to be sent to the trash.

Send2Trash.NET was ported to C# to allow Xenon File Manager to trash files on freedesktop operating systems.
